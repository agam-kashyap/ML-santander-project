## Problem Statement
The issue being faced by the Santander Bank was that the recommendation system gave a large number of recommendations to a small number of customers, while many others rarely received any. This resulted in a uneven customer experience. The challenge given to us leads to the solution of this problem. We are supposed to predict the top 5 products that a customer will either buy or drop in the upcoming month, given several features describing the characteristics of a customer and their past behaviour.
